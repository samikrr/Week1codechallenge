Prerequisite
Create a repository on your GitHub account.
Use Javascript to wire down the solution.
Push the solution to the above repository once done.
Submit the repository link for grading.
Ensure your repository has a well written README.
Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

Solution1 program
create a prompt window in solution1.js to enter students marks. If studentmarks is between 0 and 100 print the correct grade. Use if statements to grade marks based on the range. Output 'Invalid input' if the grade is not within the range given 0 to 100.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Solution2 program
Create speed.html and solution2.js. Create a button with an id in js file to call the function. Create a function speeddetector in the js file. create event listener on js file to call the function when id button is clicked .

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
